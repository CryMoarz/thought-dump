Experimental Thought Dump by CryMoarz
This repository is my personal, informal space to collect and organize raw ideas, notes, and white papers related to topics I’m exploring, especially around neurodiversity, organizational design, and innovation.

Everything here is my own thoughts and theories, shared as they are in this early, unpolished form.

It’s a sandbox for early-stage thinking and brainstorming, where I dump evolving concepts without worrying about polish or completeness.

If you’re curious, feel free to explore or reach out. Feedback and collaboration are welcome but not expected, this is primarily my thought playground.
